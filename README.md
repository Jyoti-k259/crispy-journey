>***Bigdata Project utilizing RAPID MINER AND ML Algorithm***
>***The purpose of this project was to implement the Bigdata skillset in order to perform the Train,validate and test the analystics model with different segments of Data***


- 1. This project was to fetch a representative sample of records from different  years between 1993 to 2009,most likely a sample consisting between 45,000 to - 60,000 records per year.

- 2.	 Load it  into Hadoop as a Combined Years table

- 3.	Add a new column called Delayed to the Combined Years table.

- 4.	Populate the Delayed column as follows
  a.	Insert a “N”   if the record has  a value of zero or less than zero in the ArrDelay  and  DepDelay columns
  b.	Insert a “Y”   otherwise

- 5.	Select an analytics model that can predict which unknown new records will have no delays

- 6.	Train, validate and test the analytics model with different segments of your sample data
